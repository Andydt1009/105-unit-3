# Engl 105 Feeder 3.1

This github repository contains a large dataset of public health data from various counties from each state across the country

The data has been provided by UNC's Davis Library Research Hub, and contains code from a Jupyter notebook

This data has been filtered down to focus specifically on data from counties in North Carolina

This data has been further filtered down to analyze adult obesity rates across NC counties, and compare them to the access individuals in each county have to exercise opportunities

Data repository was created for Prof. Gotzler's Engl 105 class at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

This github repository is the final project for Unit 3 of the fall section of Engl 105
