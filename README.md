# Engl 105 Feeder 3.1

This repository contains a python notebook containins a large public data set of health in different counties across the country 

The data has been provided by UNC's Davis Library Research Hub, and contains code from a Jupyter notebook

This data has been scaled down to focus specifically on data in the state of North Carolina 

Data was scaled down in order to look at a small subset of data from a large database

Data is to be used by reseachers and/or medical professionals who work primarily in NC
